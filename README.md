# Polaris

## Overview

This repository hosts the code and data for NIPS'18 paper: Interpreting Neural Network Judgments via Minimal, Stable, and Symbolic Corrections.

## Prerequisites

You can install all the required packages natively, but we recommend using [conda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html).

1. Create an environment:

   ```
   conda create -n polaris python=3.6 tensorflow keras 
   source activate polaris
   ```
2. Install cleverhans
   ```
   pip install cleverhans
   ```
## Running the experiments

## Training the models

Instead of using pre-trained models, you can train your own models. (Coming soon)
